<h1>Rethink taxes for education?</h1><br>
This is a small repository to show a data analytic project about patterns in public education spending and its possible later effects.<br>
It uses publicly available data from world bank source, which is collected in WB folder.<br>
I was curious to see if such data would yield insight about which field of expenditure might show measureable effects.<br><br>
You find the analytic prerequisites in the ipynb file.<br>
You find the public result in https://arnodell.hopto.org/wordpress/index.php/rethink-taxes-for-education/
<br><br>
Any remarks and suggestions are highly welcome!<br><br>
<h2>Installation:</h2>
All code is here in the Jupyter notebook.<br>
It expects installed python 3.12, together with pip, and jupyter-notebook.
All further necessary python modules will be installed by running the first code cell of the notebook.
<br><br>
All used data is already assembled in the WB folder.<br>
We are thankful to the open data program of the world bank, which gave us the data files under https://open.worldbank.org
