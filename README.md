<h1>Rethink taxes for education?</h1><br>
This is a small repository to show a data analytic project about patterns in public education spending and its possible later effects.<br>
It uses publicly available data from world bank source, which is collected in WB folder.<br>
I was curious to see if such data would yield insight about which field of expenditure might show measureable effects.<br><br>
You find the analytic prerequisites in the ipynb file.<br>
You find the public result in https://arnodell.hopto.org/wordpress/index.php/rethink-taxes-for-education/

Any remarks and suggestions are highly welcome!
